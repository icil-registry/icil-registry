## 1. Purpose

This charter defines the **governance structure, authority boundaries, and accountability mechanisms** of ICIL.

Its purpose is to:
- Ensure institutional neutrality
- Prevent concentration of power
- Maintain long-term credibility and independence
- Protect ICIL from founder, commercial, or external influence

This document **implements** the constraints defined in `LOCKED_STATE.md`.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

ICIL governance operates on the following principles:

1. **Independence**  
   Governance decisions are independent of founders, operators, and marketplaces.

2. **Transparency**  
   Governance structure and decisions are publicly documented.

3. **Accountability**  
   Governance members are accountable to documented rules, not discretion.

4. **Restraint**  
   Governance exists to protect integrity, not to exert control.

---

## 3. Governance Structure

### 3.1 Governing Committee

ICIL is overseen by an **Independent Governing Committee (IGC)**.

The IGC is responsible for:
- Oversight of ICIL operations
- Ensuring adherence to locked specifications
- Reviewing disputes and governance violations
- Approving version upgrades and policy changes

---

### 3.2 Composition

The IGC SHALL consist of:
- An odd number of members (minimum 3)
- Members from diverse, non-conflicting backgrounds
- No majority representation from any single interest group

Active marketplace operators, advertisers, or agencies may not form a majority.

---

## 4. Founder Role & Limitations (LOCKED)

The founder of ICIL:

- Has **no unilateral decision authority**
- Cannot override scores, evidence, or disputes
- Holds no special voting rights
- May participate only as a non-controlling member, if at all

Founder powers are explicitly limited to:
- System initialization
- Infrastructure stewardship (non-decision-making)

---

## 5. Authority Boundaries

The IGC MAY:
- Interpret procedural compliance
- Enforce governance rules
- Approve versioned changes

The IGC MAY NOT:
- Modify individual scores
- Create ad-hoc rules
- Grant exceptions to specific entities
- Exercise subjective judgment on credibility

---

## 6. Decision-Making Process

### 6.1 Voting

- Decisions require a documented vote
- Simple majority for routine matters
- Supermajority for:
  - Version upgrades
  - Charter amendments
  - Governance sanctions

Voting records are retained.

---

### 6.2 Quorum

- A quorum requires a majority of IGC members
- Decisions made without quorum are invalid

---

## 7. Conflict of Interest

All governance members MUST:
- Declare conflicts of interest
- Recuse themselves from affected decisions

Failure to disclose conflicts constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 8. Member Appointment & Removal

### 8.1 Appointment

- Terms are defined and renewable

---

### 8.2 Removal

A governance member may be removed for:

Sensitive deliberations may remain confidential.

---

## 10. Sanctions & Violations

Sanctions are proportional and documented.

---
